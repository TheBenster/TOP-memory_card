# Memory Card Game with React Hooks and External API

This project is assigned to you in The Odin Project curriculum to reinforce and challenge its students in the concepts learned thus far. Including:

- React Hooks: I'm actively using hooks like useState and useEffect to efficiently manage state and interact with the external API.
- The actual API: External API Interaction: Fetching data from an external API plays a key role, allowing me to integrate interesting data (images or other information) into the game.

My Goals:
- Build a Functional Memory Game: I aim to create a fully functional Memory game using React and data retrieved from an external API.
- Master Hook Usage: Applying hooks for state management and interacting with the API is central to this project, allowing me to gain deeper proficiency in using them effectively.
- Enhance Design Skills: I'm working on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for the game, further developing my styling skills.
